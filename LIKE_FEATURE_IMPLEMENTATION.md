# Like Feature Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive like system with celebratory animations, Firebase integration, and automatic profile navigation.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Firebase Likes Service** (`src/services/likesService.ts`)
- **Bidirectional Like Relationships**: `createLike()` function creates like records
- **Dislike/Pass Tracking**: `createDislike()` records passes for filtering
- **Real-time Updates**: `subscribeLikes()` provides live updates
- **Match Detection**: `likeUserBack()` creates matches when mutual likes exist
- **Like Management**: Functions for dismissing likes and checking existing likes

### 2. **Animated Like Button** (`src/components/AnimatedLikeButton.tsx`)
- **Celebratory Animation**: Heart scale/pulse effect with particle burst
- **Smooth Transitions**: 500ms animation duration for satisfying feedback
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Button scale bounce (0.8 → 1.2 → 1.0)
  - Rotation wiggle effect
  - 8 particle hearts radiating outward
  - Opacity and scale animations on particles

### 3. **Discovery Screen Updates** (`src/screens/DiscoverScreen.tsx`)
- **Like Action Flow**:
  - First like: Direct like with animation → Navigate to next
  - Second like: Text modal (80+ chars) → Navigate to next
  - Third+ likes: Video requirement → Navigate to next
- **Dislike Action**: Records dislike → Navigate to next
- **Firebase Integration**: Creates like/dislike records
- **Profile Queue**: Automatic progression through profiles
- **Redux Integration**: Updates like count for progressive requirements

### 4. **Likes Screen Updates** (`src/screens/LikesScreen.tsx`)
- **Real Firebase Data**: `getLikesReceived()` fetches actual likes
- **Real-time Subscription**: Live updates when new likes are received
- **Match Creation**: "Like back" creates matches and shows celebration
- **Dismiss Feature**: Remove unwanted likes
- **Pull to Refresh**: Manual refresh capability

### 5. **Security Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
- **Likes Collection**:
  - Users can only create likes from their own account
  - Recipients can update like status
  - Both parties can read their likes
- **Dislikes Collection**:
  - Users can only create/read their own dislikes
  - No updates allowed (immutable record)
- **Matches Collection**:
  - Both matched users can read/update
  - Created when mutual likes exist

## User Experience Flow

1. **Discovery Tab**:
   - User sees profile → Taps like button
   - Heart animation plays (scale, rotation, particles)
   - Like recorded in Firebase
   - Profile automatically advances after 500ms

2. **Likes Tab**:
   - Shows all users who liked current user
   - Real-time updates when new likes arrive
   - "Like back" creates match with celebration alert
   - "Pass" dismisses the like

3. **Progressive Engagement**:
   - Like #1: Simple tap to like
   - Like #2: 80+ character message required
   - Like #3+: Video introduction required

## Technical Implementation Details

### Animation Specifications
```typescript
// Button press animation sequence
scale: 0.8 → 1.2 → 1.0 (spring animation)
rotation: -10° → 10° → 0° (100ms each)
heart scale: 1.0 → 1.3 → 1.0 (with delay)
particles: opacity 0 → 1 → 0, scale 0.5 → 1.5
```

### Firebase Data Structure
```typescript
// Likes collection
{
  id: "fromUserId_toUserId",
  fromUserId: string,
  toUserId: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  status: "pending" | "matched" | "dismissed",
  text?: string,        // For text likes
  videoUrl?: string     // For video likes
}

// Dislikes collection
{
  id: "fromUserId_toUserId",
  fromUserId: string,
  toUserId: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}

// Matches collection
{
  id: "userId1_userId2", // Sorted alphabetically
  user1Id: string,
  user2Id: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastActivity: Timestamp
}
```
